# AGENTS.md

## Overview

The Agent OS Protocol is a comprehensive framework designed to orchestrate, manage, and execute AI agents in a distributed, scalable environment. This document outlines the agent architecture, capabilities, and integration patterns within the protocol.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Skills Framework
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple agents and manages task distribution
- **Planner**: Breaks down complex objectives into actionable tasks
- **Executor**: Handles the actual execution of agent tasks

#### 2. System Intelligence
- **Registry**: Manages agent registration and discovery
- **Environment**: Handles configuration and environment management
- **Sandbox**: Provides isolated execution environments
- **Settings**: Manages agent preferences and configurations

#### 3. Context Management
- **Apps**: Application-specific context and data
- **Documents**: Document processing and management
- **Memory**: Persistent memory and knowledge storage
- **Vector**: Vector database integration for semantic search
- **Persistence**: Data persistence and retrieval

#### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Audit**: Monitors agent behavior and compliance
- **Judge**: Evaluates agent performance and output quality
- **Rules**: Defines behavioral constraints and guidelines
- **Screenshot**: Visual validation and monitoring
- **Fallback**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Agent Types

### 1. Orchestrator Agents
- **Purpose**: Coordinate multiple agents and manage complex workflows
- **Capabilities**: Task distribution, load balancing, conflict resolution
- **Integration**: Works with planner and executor agents

### 2. Planner Agents
- **Purpose**: Break down high-level objectives into actionable tasks
- **Capabilities**: Task decomposition, dependency analysis, resource estimation
- **Integration**: Receives objectives from orchestrators, provides plans to executors

### 3. Executor Agents
- **Purpose**: Execute specific tasks and operations
- **Capabilities**: Tool usage, API interactions, data processing
- **Integration**: Receives tasks from planners, reports back to orchestrators

### 4. Specialized Agents
- **Context Agents**: Manage and provide contextual information
- **Quality Agents**: Monitor and ensure output quality
- **Workflow Agents**: Handle specific workflow patterns and parallelization

## Agent Lifecycle

### 1. Registration
- Agents register with the system registry
- Capabilities and constraints are defined
- Resource requirements are specified

### 2. Discovery
- Agents can discover other agents and their capabilities
- Dynamic service discovery based on task requirements
- Load balancing and failover mechanisms

### 3. Execution
- Task assignment and execution
- Real-time monitoring and feedback
- Error handling and recovery

### 4. Evaluation
- Performance monitoring and quality assessment
- Learning and adaptation based on outcomes
- Continuous improvement and optimization

## Integration Patterns

### 1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
- Standardized communication between agents
- Tool and resource sharing
- Context propagation and synchronization

### 2. Workflow Orchestration
- Parallel task execution
- Dependency management
- Resource optimization

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop
- Human oversight and intervention
- Approval workflows
- Manual task delegation
